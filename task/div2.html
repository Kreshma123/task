<h1>MOISTURIZER</h1>
<p>NIVEA Creme builds a protective layer that guards the skin from harmful external influences like heat, cold, humidity and pollution. It not only cares for the skin, but also prevents loss of moisture by retaining it within the skin. As a result, the skin remains naturally beautiful and well cared for. NIVEA Creme is an everyday, multi-purpose moisturising cream for oily skin which protects and gives relief from damaged skin, leaving it healthy. It can be used in countless ways. It is a popular day cream and night cream. You can even use it on your lips when they get chapped in the cold weather. </p>
